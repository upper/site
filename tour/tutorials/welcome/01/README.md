# Hello!

Welcome to the [upper/db][1] tour.

Here, you’ll learn how to use [upper/db][1] in your project. The current
version of `upper/db` is v4.

The example code displayed on the right is interactive. You can click on Run to
see the output. Feel free to edit the code and run it as often as needed.

Please remember that this tour uses read-only databases in a sandboxed
environment, so any operations that would alter the environment (such as write
operations) won’t work.

If you want to improve anything, please do and submit your pull request. The
tour’s code is [here](https://github.com/upper/tour).

Have fun ✌️!
