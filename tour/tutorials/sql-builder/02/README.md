## a) SQL Builder: JOIN Queries and Struct Composition

Now, let's suppose you have independent Go structs (each one mapped to a
different table) and a JOIN query that returns a result combining columns from
all the mapped tables.

In this scenario, you can create a new struct and embed all the structs using
the `inline` option (`db:",inline"`), like in the following example (where
`Book`, `Author`, and `Subject` are independent structs):

```go
type BookAuthorSubject struct {
  Book    `db:",inline"`
  Author  `db:",inline"`
  Subject `db:",inline"`
}
```

... and then create the JOIN query using the builder:


```go
q := sess.Select("b.id AS book_id", "*").
  From("books AS b").
  Join("subjects AS s").On("b.subject_id = s.id").
  Join("authors AS a").On("b.author_id = a.id").
  OrderBy("a.last_name", "b.title")
```

Note that an alias for `book_id` is created with `Select("b.id AS book_id",
"*")`.  This is because all three embedded structs have a field with the same
name (`id`), which is ambiguous. The final struct (`BookAuthorSubject`) should
look like this:

```go
type BookAuthorSubject struct {
  BookID   uint `db:"book_id"`

  Book    `db:",inline"`
  Author  `db:",inline"`
  Subject `db:",inline"`
}
```

Finally, use `All` to copy every single result of the query into the `books`
slice:

```go
var books []BookAuthorSubject
err := q.All(&books)
```
