# Query large result sets

If you're working with significantly large data sets, copying all matching
records into a slice might be impractical for memory and performance reasons.

In this case, you might want to use `Next` to map all the records in the
result-set one by one:

```go
res := booksTable.Find().OrderBy("-id")

var book Book
for res.Next(&book) {
  // ...
}
```

`Next` will return `true` until there are no more records left to be read in
the result set.

When handling results individually, you'll also need to manually check for
errors (with `Err`) and free locked resources (with `Close`).

```go
res := booksTable.Find(...)
defer res.Close()

for res.Next(&book) {
  ...
}

if err := res.Err(); err != nil {
  ...
}
```

Calling `Close` is not required when using `One` or `All`, as they're closed
automatically.
